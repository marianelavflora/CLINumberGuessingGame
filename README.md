# CLI Number Guessing Game
A little challenge from https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game. 

## Brief Description 

This script implements a simple CLI number-guessing game, the kind you played when you were a kid. A short and fun project to go back to the basics.

The player's goal is to guess a randomly generated number within a range based on a selected difficulty level. The game provides feedback to guide the player toward the correct answer.

### An Example Match

```text
Welcome to this Number Guessing Game! Your mission is to simply guess the number that I am thinking of!
These are the rules:
1. You have only a certain number of chances based on the difficulty.
2. If you guess correctly, congratulations!
3. If you donâ€™t guess correctly, the game will tell you if the number is greater or less than your guess.

Select your difficulty level by typing the number: 
0. Easy - 8 tries
1. Medium - 5 tries
2. Hard - 3 tries 
>> 1
Attempt 1/5: Enter your guess: 50
Nope! The magic number is greater. Tries left: 4
...
Congrats! You got it right!
Wanna try again? Yes or no: no
Thanks for playing! Goodbye!
